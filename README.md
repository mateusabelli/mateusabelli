I'm **Mateus** `/mah-teh-oos/`, an **open source** developer **enthusiast**. I enjoy using my skills and being creative to solve problems, or just to have fun creating and learning.

I work as a tech support assistant by day, and by night I work as a developer of my future. You can reach me via **e-mail** and I'll be happy to reply to your message _asap_.
